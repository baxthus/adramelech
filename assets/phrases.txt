@@ I Didn't Realize, The Drums
Forgive me
For the faith I had in us
What do you do
When everything is not enough

@@ Book of Stories, The Drums
I thought my life would get easier
Instead it's getting harder, instead it's getting harder
I thought my life would get easier
Instead it's getting darker, instead it's getting colder
Without you

@@ Black Friday, Tom Odell
I wanna go party, I wanna have fun
I wanna be happy, could you show me how it's done?

@@ Black Friday, Tom Odell
It's all in my head, it's all in my mind
I see the darkness where you see the light
It's all in my head, who do I trust?
I thought that you loved me, what is happening to us?

@@ Beach House, Del Water Gap
All I need is a place to go
Her sweat, cigarette, till I'm back in the madness
Let me leave, I don't wanna know
Her sweat, sunset, for a taste of the habit
